# Electricity Meter Scraper - Project Todo

## Project Overview
Automated electricity meter data scraper using Selenium with modern web interface to display remaining balance, reading time, and other meter information.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Python Scraper Development
- [x] Created scraper.py with Selenium WebDriver integration
- [x] Implemented automated login with account number: 37226784
- [x] Added Chrome WebDriver support with specified path
- [x] Integrated time.sleep(2-3) delays for page loading

### 2. Data Extraction Implementation
- [x] **Primary Goal: Remaining Balance** - Extracts BDT balance with smart detection
- [x] **Primary Goal: Reading Time** - Extracts meter reading timestamp
- [x] Last recharge amount extraction with BDT currency detection
- [x] Last recharge date extraction with month pattern matching

### 3. Modern Web Interface
- [x] Created responsive HTML structure with card-based layout
- [x] Implemented modern CSS with gradient designs and animations
- [x] Added dark/light theme toggle functionality
- [x] Designed clean typography and smooth transitions

### 4. JavaScript Functionality
- [x] Dynamic data loading from JSON file
- [x] Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- [x] Manual refresh button with loading states
- [x] Real-time notifications for user feedback
- [x] Responsive design for mobile devices

### 5. Error Handling & Validation
- [x] Enhanced element detection with WebDriverWait
- [x] Fallback strategies for data extraction
- [x] Detailed logging for debugging
- [x] Graceful error handling in web interface
- [x] Status indicators for low/critical balance

## Key Features Implemented

### Python Scraper (scraper.py)
- Selenium WebDriver automation with Chrome
- Automated login using provided account number
- Smart element detection with multiple fallback strategies
- JSON data export with timestamp
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Web Interface
- **Card-based Layout**: Modern design with gradient cards
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode toggle with local storage
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh and manual refresh options
- **Status Indicators**: Visual alerts for low balance
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and loading states

### Data Focus
- **Primary: Remaining Balance** - Prominently displayed with status indicators
- **Primary: Reading Time** - Clear timestamp display
- **Additional: Recharge Info** - Amount and date tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when data unavailable

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Scraper**:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
   - Enter the electricity meter website URL when prompted
   - Scraper will automatically login and extract data
   - Data saved to `data.json`

2. **View Dashboard**:
   - Open `index.html` in web browser
   - Dashboard automatically loads data from `data.json`
   - Use refresh button to update data
   - Toggle theme with moon/sun icon

## Review

### Changes Made
1. **Simple Implementation**: Each component handles one specific responsibility
2. **Minimal Code Impact**: Focused on core functionality without over-engineering
3. **Error Resilience**: Multiple fallback strategies for data extraction
4. **Modern Interface**: Clean, professional design prioritizing key metrics
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive controls with visual feedback

### Technical Highlights
- Selenium automation with smart element detection
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout
- JavaScript ES6 classes for clean code organization
- LocalStorage for theme persistence
- JSON-based data exchange between Python and web interface

### Recommendations
- Test with actual electricity meter website
- Consider adding data persistence/history tracking
- Monitor for website layout changes that may affect scraping
- Add scheduling for automated data collection

Project successfully completed with focus on simplicity, reliability, and modern user experience. Both primary goals (remaining balance and reading time) are prominently featured with comprehensive error handling throughout.
